- 👋 Hi, I’m @Incognito (Brian Graham)
- 👀 I’m presently the founder and coach @ BuildingBetterTeams.de where I work on anything that helps improve tech leadership and overall building of better teams.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning business stuff like how to build a brand, etc. One day I will have some free space from running the business and get into Rust again.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on... reach out to me if you've thought an absurdly silly amount about software dependencies.
- 📫 How to reach me: Find me on Rands or on Discord (incognito#6912)
